# Demo Code
As a quick start, a demo script is provided in NIDS.py. In the demo, we run Kitsune on a network capture of the Mirai malware. You can either run it directly or enter the following into your python console
```
import NIDS.py
```

The code was written and with the Python environment Anaconda: https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python

For significant speedups, as shown in our paper, you must implement Kitsune in C++, or entirely using cython.
